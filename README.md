🧠 Mini NLP Toolkit – Text Correction, Readability & Emotion Detection

A beginner-friendly Natural Language Processing (NLP) project built in Python that performs three key text analysis tasks:
✅ Spelling Correction using TextBlob
✅ Readability Scoring using TextStat
✅ Emotion Detection using Hugging Face Transformers

Designed for students and beginners exploring NLP fundamentals in a clean and interactive way using Jupyter Notebook.

🚀 Features
🔤 Spell Correction – Automatically corrects spelling and grammar errors in a sentence.
📖 Readability Analysis – Calculates Flesch Reading Ease and Gunning Fog Index to show how easy your text is to read.
💬 Emotion Detection – Identifies emotions like joy, sadness, anger, or fear from a given sentence using a pre-trained model.
Simple, modular, and well-commented code for learning and experimentation.

🧠 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries:textblob – for spell correction and NLP tasks
textstat – for readability scores
transformers (Hugging Face) – for emotion detection
torch – required backend for transformers

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
